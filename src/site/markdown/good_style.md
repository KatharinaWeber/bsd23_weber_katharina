# Good Coding Style

### good source code comments
- should not duplicate the code
- good comments do not excuse unclear code
- If you can't write clear comments, there may be a problem with the code
- comments should dispel confusion, not cause it
- Explain unidiomatic code in comments
- Provide links to the original source of copied code
- Include links to external references where they will be most helpful
- Add comments when fixing bugs
- Use comments to mark incomplete implementations for example TODOs



### good git commit messages
communicate context of changes

1. Line between summary/heading and main text
2. Short summary/heading less than 50 characters
3. Short summary/heading starts with capital letter
4. No . at the end of the short summary/heading
5. Use the imperative mood in the summary/heading
6. Main text should line break after 72 characters
7. In main text describe what and why and not how
